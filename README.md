## Functions
- Outside Solver enables users to plug in the inside shapes and outside shapes, and immediately read off the required dissections needed to complete the outside room.
- Inside Guide provides a step-by-step guide for the inside rooms, given the user's own shape.
- Tutorial contains tips and tricks for the encounter itself.
- The app is optimised for mobile devices. Users can navigate the app with their phones easily while playing on their PCs or consoles.

## Motivation
Verity is the most unique and mechanically challenging raid encounter in Destiny's history. However, the encounter can be much simpler than what it looks like, and this companion app can greatly aid players in completing the encounter!

## How to Run
1. Git clone the repo
 
Go to command prompt, navigate to the directory you want, and type `git clone https://github.com/saffronrust/VerityCompanion.git`

2. Install dependencies

Type `npm install` in the same directory.

3. Start the app

Type `npm run dev` in the same directory.

4. Have fun!

## Future Plans
I would like to add an additional feature where players can check their teammates' fashion, but wrangling with Bungie's API is proving to be a much, much tougher task than I anticipated. Nevertheless, I'm quite happy with this app as it is! If you have any bugs to report, or features you'll like to see implemented, please let me know!
